                Entry clearance is permission granted to anyone outside the UK to enter into the country. This has normally been a practice for those of non-EU/EEA nationality, with a need to obtain a visa to enter into the UK: for work or study purposes or for family purposes or as visitors. An applicant must apply from a British embassy or consulate or, in some areas, from an application centre in the applicant’s home country.

                    If you wish to travel to the UK, you must obtain a valid entry clearance in advance of your travel, a process that Lumine Solicitors experienced team can guide you through. Entry clearance is an application made from outside the UK and is used by Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) before you enter the UK to verify that you qualify for entry to the UK.
